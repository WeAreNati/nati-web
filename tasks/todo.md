# Security Review for NATI Web Project

## Tasks Completed ‚úÖ

- [x] Analyze project structure and identify file types
- [x] Review frontend code for sensitive information exposure  
- [x] Check for hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- [x] Analyze authentication and authorization mechanisms
- [x] Review input validation and sanitization
- [x] Check for XSS, CSRF, and injection vulnerabilities
- [x] Review dependency security and package.json
- [x] Check environment variable handling

## Security Findings Summary

### ‚úÖ Good Security Practices Found

1. **External Links Security**: All external links properly use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and `target="_blank"`
2. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No API keys, passwords, or sensitive credentials found in the codebase
3. **No Direct Inline Event Handlers**: HTML doesn't contain `onclick`, `onerror`, etc. handlers
4. **Content Security**: Uses proper meta tags and structured HTML
5. **LocalStorage Usage**: Minimal and appropriate use (only for shopping cart data)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations & Recommendations

#### 1. **Third-Party Dependencies** (Medium Risk)
- **Issue**: Large vendor.js file contains external libraries (GSAP, Lenis)
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Verify all third-party libraries are from trusted sources
  - Keep dependencies updated to latest secure versions
  - Consider using CDN with SRI (Subresource Integrity) hashes

#### 2. **IFrame Security** (Medium Risk)
- **Issue**: External iframes loaded from:
  - `https://app.uniswap.org/` (line 421, index.html)
  - `https://www.nativerusbridge.com/` (line 525, index.html)
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Add `sandbox` attribute to iframes to restrict permissions
  - Consider iframe CSP headers
  - Validate that these external services are trustworthy

#### 3. **Dynamic HTML Injection** (Low Risk)
- **Issue**: Store.js uses `innerHTML` for dynamic content (lines 93, 287, 319)
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Current usage appears safe (controlled data sources)
  - Consider using DOM methods instead of innerHTML for better security
  - Add input sanitization if dynamic data ever comes from user input

#### 4. **Client-Side Data Storage** (Low Risk)
- **Issue**: Shopping cart data stored in localStorage
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Current implementation is acceptable for non-sensitive data
  - Never store sensitive information in localStorage

#### 5. **HTTPS Enforcement** (Informational)
- **Recommendation**: Ensure production site enforces HTTPS and uses HSTS headers

### üîí No Critical Vulnerabilities Found

The codebase appears to be a legitimate cryptocurrency promotional website with an e-commerce component. No malicious code, data exfiltration attempts, or critical security vulnerabilities were detected.

### External URLs Identified (All Legitimate)

**Social Media & Communication:**
- Twitter/X, Telegram, Discord, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Reddit
- Linktree, Medium, Email contact

**Cryptocurrency Services:**
- Uniswap, Etherscan, Dextools, CoinGecko, VerusMarkets
- Contract addresses and token information

**App Stores:**
- Apple App Store, Google Play Store (for MetaMask)

## Overall Security Assessment: ‚úÖ SECURE

The codebase follows security best practices for a static website with e-commerce functionality. No sensitive information is exposed in the frontend code, and the identified considerations are standard precautions rather than vulnerabilities.

July 2, 2025

## Next Actions
- Monitor third-party dependencies for security updates
- Consider implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Verify iframe sources remain trustworthy
